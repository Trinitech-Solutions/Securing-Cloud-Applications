<h1>Securng-Cloud-Applications</h1>

 ### [YouTube Demonstration]()

<h2>Description</h2>
For my first project I combined many of the topics learn't in previous classes 
to create and deploy my own "cyber-blog" web application using Microsoft Azure. 
Secured it with a SSL certificate, and applied some of Azure's security features to protect the app. 
<br/>


<h2>Technologies Used</h2>

- <b>Azure: {Keyvaults, App Services, Front Door, WAF} PHP, HTML, Docker, OpenSSL
</b> 

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Developed and designed a cyber-blog web application using Azure’s Cloud services and Docker.</b> 
- <b>Created and stored SSL certificates in Azure’s Key Vault, and bound them to secure the web application.</b> 
- <b>Protected the web application by utilizing Azure’s Security features, such as Azure’s Front Door, WAF, and Security Center.</b>
